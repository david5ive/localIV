Title: Estimation of Marginal Treatment Effects from Selection Models
Version: 0.1.0

Description: In selection models, the marginal treatment effect (MTE) can be used
  as a building block for constructing causal parameters such as the average treatment
  effect (ATE), the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT), and the average
  treatment effect on the untreated (ATU) (Heckman, Urzua, and Vytlacil 2006 <https://doi.org/10.1162/rest.88.3.389>).
  The main function mte() estimates the MTE (via either local instrumental variables or
  a normal selection model) and also its projection onto the 2-dimensional space of the
  propensity score and a latent variable representing unobserved resistance to treatment
  (Zhou and Xie 2018 <https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/xzhou/files/zhou-xie_mte2.pdf>).
  The object returned by mte() can be used to estimate conventional estimands such as
  ATE and ATT (via average()) or marginal policy-relevant treatment effects (via mprte()).
