Description: In the generalized Roy model, the marginal treatment effect (MTE) can be used as
  a building block for constructing conventional causal parameters such as the average treatment
  effect (ATE) and the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT). Given a treatment selection model
  and an outcome model, the function mte() estimates the MTE via the semiparametric local instrumental variables
  method or via the normal selection model. The function mte_at() evaluates MTE at different values of the 
  covariates x and the latent resistance u, and the function mte_tilde_at() evaluates MTE
  projected onto the estimated propensity score. The function ace() can be used estimate population-average
  causal effects such as the ATE and ATT or the marginal policy relevant treatment effect.
